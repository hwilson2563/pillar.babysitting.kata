I have created a babysitting calculator using javascript and the jquery library.
All the required scripts to run this program are attached in the index. 
As required I have set the times to whole hours so there are no fractional hours worked, requiring the user to round to the appropriate time. 
I have set up if statements and else statements to make sure the user enter valid times.
To calculate the cost I have mathematical equations to determine hours worked and then multiplying the hours  they work by the appropriate wage.
For the application to be user friendly I have added a break down of the costs. Below are the rates set: 
  paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
  paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
  paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
All the user must do is enter each of the inputs and click on the “submit time” button and the results are displayed at the top of their screen.
If the user wants to calculate a different time they can easily click "enter new time" and it takes you back to the input screen.
